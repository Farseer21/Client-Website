I stream lined the class selector of the three linked boxes on the middle and bottom of the page. 
I changed the classes in to IDs and then added a large grab 
There were several lines of repeating text that was supurfluous, I consolidated then down to a single class to act in a more effectent and effecve manner. Saving space and making "at a glance recongnition" to be easier to acheive. 
I played around with media querries. I'm not sure I quite achieved the desired result. However, It is still functional. The site still functions. 
The code is overall streamlined functional. Each link is functional and the margines between divs are not crossing into each other.
